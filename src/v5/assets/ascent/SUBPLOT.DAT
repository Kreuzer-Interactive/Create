"You snatch the gem from the gnomes outsretched hands. You spare its life"
"because even if you wanted to kill it you do not have time. You sprint"
"down the hall, and whirl around the corner, moving as fast as you can on"
"your journey back to the portal. A gnome steps in front of you but you are"
"too close to let it bother you now, so you give it a couple of bullet holes"
"to worry about as you rush past. Half an hour later you dive, and roll back"
"up to a standing position on the other side of the portal, your side. Earth"
"sweet earth! You hold out the gem and slice it across the portal._"

"As you ascend the ladder you see a figure laying at the top. As you approach"
"the fallen, bleeding man he takes a rasping breath and begins to speak"
"`There are ceatures here... They are the--'. With that last breath he dies._"
5
"By the stairs is a hastily scrawled note that reads: They are not of this"
"world, and as of yet are only partially into our dimension, which causes"
"them to blur against the halls they constructed here. The portal must be"
"closed!_"
6
"At the top of the stairs you encounter a creature. It tries to run but you"
"have it cornered in a dead end passage, and it cannot get by you."
"`Glerrsst anam livitsss! Ctholrt!' The creature babbles on, and you realize"
"that what it says translates to `Please don't kill me.' "
"`Give me a reason', you write on the wall in their langauge. Apparently it"
"understands. `There is a gem. Slash it vertically across a portal to close"
"it.' The creature then quickly scampers off before you can stop it._"
9
"You find some ammo and pick it up, thanking god that they haven't"
"figured out to use the modern weapons that they've confiscated yet._"
12
"At the top of the level you find a another hidden cache of ammo to help"
"replenish your dwindling supply._"
13
"At the top of the ladder is a long tunnel through which you can barely make"
"out the gleam light at the end. Sunlight! Watching hostages crawl down the"
"tunnel you reflect that those might be the last people you ever see. "
"You think about following after them, but at last decide against it and"
"continue on your quest to close the portal._"
14
"After an intense battle, the green creature crumbles to the floor and your"
"hands close around the glowing gem. Now you have the means of closing the "
"portal!_"
15
"At the top of the ladder you stumble upon some more ammunition. There is a"
"god!_"
16
"After you reach the top of the ladder you suddenly feel extremly tired."
"You prop yourself up next to the wall and rest your eyes for a moment and"
"fail to notice when a ceature nears you and snatches the gem until it is"
"too late. Before you realize, it is out of sight and pursuit is futile."
"Nevertheless you must try!_"
17
"You find a large cache of ammo hidden away by the stairs._"
18
"When you reach the top of the ladder you are greeted with renewed hope as"
"you see the creature with the gem dart down a hall only steps ahead of you._"
19
"You stare squintingly into the unearthly landscape which is lighted by a"
"great red sun. Your on their world now, and you just hope you can make it"
"back to your own._"
28
"You come across one of the hostages from the archeological expedition!"
"`Moving across the island we came across a hole where the ground had fallen"
"away into some kind of passage. I and a few others moved to examine the"
"hole, and suddenly I awoke down here. I don't know what happened, it all"
"went so fast. There are others alive though. You got to find them.'"
"`Don't worry', you say. `I'll get you out, and the others too. Just stay"
"a good distance behind me._"
30
"Some more hostages! The dark haired man begins to speak."
"    `How did you manage to get here? Not that it matters though, but I must"
"say I'm bloody happy to see you. I must be a sight in this dirty shirt and"
"ripped trousers. The gnomes, you see--'"
"    `Pardon!?'"
"    `Thats what I call those monsters. They're not of this world. I've "
"learned to translate their language. It seems that they are from another"
"dimension, and their science has taken a completely different turn than"
"ours. They've mastered the art of disrupting the time continium to transport"
"Themselves from one place to another instantly, even, it seems, to another"
"dimension. In this dimension though they have no solid form, merely distort"
"the light rays that pass through them. They aren't much of a threat now, but"
"once more of them come through to this dimension, and they learn how to use"
"those weapons they've taken, we'll be in for a hell of a bloody war.'"
"You tell them to stay a good distance behind you, and follow you out._"
31
"You have come across a group of three hostages!"
"You talk for a while, but learn little new. `Two levels above this one there"
"should be a long passage that will lead up and out of this place. Just two"
"more levels to go through. Above that is the castle. There is a the leader"
"of all the gnomes on the the top level of the castle. I've seen it before."
"It's not just five feet tall like most of these monsters, but over eight"
"feet.'"
"If he dies that would put a serious dent in their plans, you think. And"
"only four extra levels, you think bitterly._"
